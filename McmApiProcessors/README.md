# About McmProcessors
Processors in this directory were written due to a somewhat immediate need to rapidly scale application packaging needs with a Microsoft Configuration Manager (MCM) environment. As such, the implementation is currently, admittedly crude, and should be regarded as a ~~beta testing~~ alpha testing release.

Some pointers on items which are obviously out of place or ugly or otherwise poorly designed/implemented would be most welcome.

# Installation

## Modules

```zsh
/Library/AutoPkg/Python3/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3 -m pip install keyring
/Library/AutoPkg/Python3/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3 -m pip install requests_ntlm
/Library/AutoPkg/Python3/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3 -m pip install Pillow

```

After installing the above modules, you should also register an MCM credential in keychain. 'com.github.autopkg.iancohn-recipes.mcmapi' is not required for the -s parameter, however if specifying something custom, you'll need to note it and use it to populate the 'keychain_password_service' input variable in the processor(s) you are using manually.

```zsh
username = "username@domain.com"
security add-generic-password -a $username -s com.github.autopkg.iancohn-recipes.mcmapi -T '/Library/AutoPkg/Python3/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3' -U -w
```

| mcm_application_ci_id | The CI_ID where the application should be posted. 0 indicates a new application. |

# Complex input variables

## export_properties

A dictionary specifying the properties to retrieve, and the AutoPkg variables to use to store the output.
Each key name specified will be used as the AutoPkg variable name; each value should be populated by a dictionary "
representing how to retrieve the property from the MCM application. Supported retrieval types are 'property' and 'xpath'. "
'raise_error' specifies whether to raise an error if the property cannot be found. "

'property' type options require an 'expression' option specifying the property name to retrieve from the MCM application. "
'xpath' type options require a 'property' option specifying the property name (generally 'SDMPackageXML') to run the xpath query against, and an 'expression'. "
The 'strip_namespaces' option may also be specified to indicate whether to strip namespaces from the XML before evaluating the xpath expression."
The 'select_value_index' option may also be specified to indicate which value to select from the xpath result set (default is '*' (return all values as an array list)). "
Positive or negative integers may be specified to select a specific index from the result set (0-based). Negative integers count from the end of the result set (-1 is the last item)."

### Examples

- **``"existing_app_securityscopes": {"type": "property", "raise_error": False,"options": {"expression": "SecuredScopeNames"}}``**
  An autopkg variable named 'existing_app_securityscopes' will be created based on the 'SecuredScopeNames' property from the object returned. If no object is returned, or if the returned object does not contain a 'SecuredScopeNames' property, no error is raised and autopkg will continue the process.
- **``"app_logical_name": {"type": "xpath", "raise_error": True,"options": {"select_value_index": '0', "strip_namespaces": False, "property": "SDMPackageXML", "expression": '/*[local-name()="AppMgmtDigest"]/*[local-name()="Application"]/@LogicalName'}}``**
  An autopkg variable named 'app_logical_name will be created by executing the xpath expression indicated against the 'SDMPackageXML' property of the returned object. If the property cannot be found an error will be raised.
- **``"app_content_locations": {"type": "xpath", "raise_error": False,"options": {"select_value_index": '*', "strip_namespaces": True, "property": "SDMPackageXML", "expression": '//Content/Location/text()'}}``**
  An autopkg variable named 'app_content_locations' will be populated by executing the xpath expression indicated against the 'SDMPackageXML' property. Namespaces will be stripped from the XML prior to executing the xpath expression. If the property cannot be found, no error is raised.

## mcm_application_configuration
The mcm_application_configuration input variable is really the core of this suite of processors and due to its complexity will undoubtedly be the most likely problem child of the bunch.

| DeploymentTypes | A list of dictionary objects conforming to the DeploymentType dictionary format &nbsp;[See below](#deploymenttype) | list(dictionary) | no | any number of properly configured dictionaries | `<None>`

### DisplayInfo
The DisplayInfo key of the [mcm_application_configuration](#mcm_application_configuration) root node can be populated with an array of localized display information objects conforming to the below standard. By default, properties will inherit their values from the default language and root application object. Most properties can be overridden, or set to `Null` or an empty string if they should be left blank.

| Key | Description | Type | Required | Possible Values | Default Value |
| --- | ----------- | ---- | -------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Language | The language that this localized display info is for | string | no | any unique, valid language string | `en-US` |
| LocalizedDisplayName | The localized display name to display for users in Software Center/Company Portal | string | yes | any string | Inherits from the default language |
| LocalizedDescription | The localized description to display for users in Software Center/Company Portal | string | no | any string | `<None>` |

| IsFeatured | Whether to feature the application in Software Center/Company portal when it is deployed as 'Available' | boolean | no | `False`,`True` | `False` |

### DeploymentType
DeploymentType objects can be somewhat tricky since the available possible values depends on the deployment or detection technology type that is used.

| Key | Description | Type | Required | Possible Values | Default Value |
| --- | ----------- | ---- | -------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Technology | The deployment technology type | string | yes | `Script`, `MSI`, (`TaskSequence` - **Not yet supported**), (`Windows8App` - **Not yet supported**) | `<None>` |
| Priority | Explicitly define the ordering of deployment types [See below](#property-notes) | int | no | any int | `<None>` |
| Options | A nested dictionary with properties specific to the deployment technology | dictionary | yes | [See below](#deployment-technology-options) | `<None>` |

#### Property Notes
* Priority
In most cases where you are only creating a new application and creating a single deployment type, can be left as Null or ommitted entirely from the dictionary. Even when creating a new app, by default, deployment types will be assigned a priority respective to their order in this list.
In more complex scenarios when 'Updating' an application object, the following behaviors can be configured where PersistUnhandledDeploymentTypes is set to `True` (setting it to False causes any existing deployment types to be dropped from the updated application object)
  - Configuring Priority to 'null' declares the following intent:
    - If the deployment type already exists, and BehaviorIfExists is set to 'Update', it will maintain its current priority.
    - If the deployment type does not already exist, or if it exists and the deployment type's BehaviorIfExists property is set to 'AppendVersion' or 'AppendIndex', it will be added to the end in the order in which it appears here.
  - Configuring Priority to a non null value will cause the deployment type to be re-ordered depending on the configuration. For example, configuring DeploymentType list objects with priorities 1, 3, and 5 would cause 2 existing deployment types which are not configured in this configuration to be interlaced into positions 2 and 4.

  When in doubt, just leave it Null

### Deployment Technology Options

#### Logon Requirement Type Notes
Not valid for 'InstallForUser' installation behavior.
'OnlyWhenNoUserIsLoggedOn' is not a valid choice when an installation behavior type of 'InstallForSystemIfResourceIsDeviceOtherwiseInstallForUser' is specified, since that effectively would make it an InstallForSystem installation behavior.

### Install Process Detection

| Key | Description | Type | Required | Possible Values | Default Value |
| --- | ----------- | ---- | -------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| ProcessName | The name of the executable file with extension | string | yes | any string | `<None>` |
| DisplayName | The display name of the process | string | no | any string | `<None>` |

### Requirements Rules
As it turns out, creating requirements can be somewhat complex depending whether built in or custom (global condition) requirements are used. As a stop gap for this, requirements rules can be defined using a raw xml string from an existing deployment type on another application object and applied to this deployment type.

| Key | Description | Type | Required | Possible Values | Default Value |
| --- | ----------- | ---- | -------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Type | The method used to define the requirement | string | yes | `XmlString`, `Dict` | `<None>` |
| Rule | The rule definition, either as [XmlString](#requirements-from-xml-strings) or [Dict](#requirements-from-dictionaries) | string, (dictionary - **Not Currently Supported**) | yes | A valid object | `<None>` |

### Requirements From XML Strings
This was easier to implement relative to to the alternative which would have to make several queries to MCM to search for global condition ids, then figure out how to construct the object from these.

**Example:**
```xml
<rule><Annotation>
  <DisplayName Text="Lots of operating systems" />
  <Description Text="" />
</Annotation>
<OperatingSystemExpression>
  <Operator>OneOf</Operator>
  <Operands>
    <RuleExpression RuleId="Windows/All_x64_Windows_7_Client" />
    <RuleExpression RuleId="Windows/All_x86_Windows_7_Client" />
    <RuleExpression RuleId="Windows/x64_Windows_7_Client" />
    <RuleExpression RuleId="Windows/x64_Windows_7_SP1" />
    <RuleExpression RuleId="Windows/x86_Windows_7_Client" />
    <RuleExpression RuleId="Windows/x86_Windows_7_SP1" />
    <RuleExpression RuleId="Windows/All_ARM64_Windows_10_and_higher_Clients" />
    <RuleExpression RuleId="Windows/All_MultiSession_Enterprise_Windows_10_higher" />
    <RuleExpression RuleId="Windows/All_x64_Windows_10_and_higher_Clients" />
    <RuleExpression RuleId="Windows/All_x86_Windows_10_and_higher_Clients" />
    <RuleExpression RuleId="Windows/All_ARM64_Windows_11_and_higher_Clients" />
    <RuleExpression RuleId="Windows/All_MultiSession_Enterprise_Windows_11_higher" />
    <RuleExpression RuleId="Windows/All_x64_Windows_11_and_higher_Clients" />
  </Operands>
</OperatingSystemExpression>
</rule>

```

### Requirements From Dictionaries
Not currently supported

### Dependency Groups
A valid dependency group will have one or more dependency. You cannot create a dependency group with 0 dependencies. All dependencies within a dependency group are functionally connected by a logical `or` operator, meaning that if ANY of the detections on the deployment types referenced in the dependency groups evaluate as installed, the dependency group itself will evaluate to `True`

| Key | Description | Type | Required | Possible Values | Default Value |
| --- | ----------- | ---- | -------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| DependencyGroupName | The name of the dependency group | string | yes | any string | `<None>` |

| Description | A description for the return code | string | no | any string | `<None>` |

### Detection
| Key | Description | Type | Required | Possible Values | Default Value |
| --- | ----------- | ---- | -------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Type | What type of detection this is [See below](#detection-type-notes) | string | yes | `File`, `Folder`, `RegistryKey`, `RegistryKeyValue`, `MSI`, `Group`, `CustomScript` | `<None>` |
| Options | A dictionary of options consistent with the Type property [See below](#detection-type-notes) | dictionary | yes | A dictionary valid for the given detection type | `<None>` |

#### Detection Type Notes
There are two main categories of detection types:
* **[Custom Script(#custom-script-detection-options)]** (CustomScript) - Detect a successful installation with a PowerShell script
PowerShell scripts which detect the installation will:
  * Output a single string (any string) if the application is installed. To indicate that the application is not installed, the script MUST NOT write out any string (or any object castable as a string)
  * Exit with a '0' exit code. Exiting with a non-zero exit code will cause detection to fail with an error, rather than detecting that the application is or is not installed
 
* **Enhanced Detection Expression** - enhanced detection expressions can be one of five types
  * **[Group Expression](#group-detection-options)** - (Group)
  * **[File](#file-detection-options)** - (File)
  * **[Folder](#folder-detection-options)** - (Folder)
  * **[Registry Key](#registry-key-detection-options)** - (RegistryKey)
  * **[Registry Key Value](#registry-key-value-detection-options)** - (RegistryKey)
  * **[MSI](#msi-detection-options)** - (MSI)

> :information_source: **Important Note:** If evaluating a property on any of the above detection methods, *Property*, *Operator*, and *Value* must all be populated. This applies to File, Folder, MSI, and RegistryKeyValue expression types

### Custom Script Detection Options

### Group Detection Options
Group expressions evaluate two or more [enhanced detection expressions](#detection-type-notes). Items in a group are connected by either 'and' or 'or' logical operators. Group expressions may contain nested group expressions, and may connect via their operator with either another group type expression or a single expression (eg. File)

| Value | The value or list of values to compare the file property value against | list(string) or string | no | any string (or list of strings if the operator is an array operator) | `<None>` |

#### File Property Comparison Operator Notes
The following operators evaluate against an array of values:
* Between
* OneOf
* NoneOf
When using an array operator, the Value property should be a list of at least two version strings.
If using the 'Between' operator, there must be exactly two version strings.

Non-array operators require 'Value' to be populated with a single string
